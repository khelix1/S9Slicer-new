     * This is a geometric infill only â€” clipping to the exact polygon is handled elsewhere.
     *
     * @param boundary A closed contour representing the fill area.
     * @param spacing Distance between infill lines in millimeters.
     * @param angle Optional infill direction in degrees (default 0 = horizontal).
     * @return std::vector<Contour> Grid lines as separate contour paths.
